# Obtaining the key to Success _(michaelbiberich/the-key-to-success)_

> A short digital treasure hunt experience.

## What is this?

*Congratulations on finding this repository!*

**Obtaining the key to Success** is a short digital treasure hunt. The goal is 
to find the correct **key** that is needed to obtain [Success].

This key has been separated into **six pieces**. All pieces must be collected 
and put together in the right way to reveal the original key.

> **Important:** Make sure that you read the whole Readme carefully!

## What will I need?

You will *at least* need the following tools:

- Something handle password protected ZIP files, like [7-Zip]
- Your browsers [Developer Tools]

You will *also* need to know the following:

- Web technologies ([HTML], [CSS] and [JavaScript])
- [Markdown] syntax
- How to use [GitHub]

The pieces of the key are hidden on these sites:

- [www.biberich.at]
- [Obtaining the key to Success] on [GitHub]

## What are the rules?

1. **Have fun :)**
2. Try to follow the leads, **don't brute force it**.
3. **Don't spoil yourself** by asking for/looking up the answers.
4. **Don't spoil others**.

## What do I do if I get stuck?

If you ever get stuck, try to stop, take a deep breath and go a step back.

Reevaluate what you already know and try to think of which things you tried and 
which not.

Here are some hints:

> The key to [Success] is *hidden in plain sight*.

> To obtain the key, one must *read between the lines*.

> See the invisible, *achieve the impossible*.

> According to the [Many-worlds interpretation] every event is a branch point, 
> creating an *alternate timeline* branching off of the current timeline.

> All hints contain important information, *even this one!*
<!-- Key piece #5 - You took the hint quite literally -->
